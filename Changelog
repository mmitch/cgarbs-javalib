1.0.0 - unreleased
------------------

 BREAKING CHANGES:

 - Resource._() has been renamed to Resource.get() because
   as of Java 9 _ is a keyword and may not be used as an identifier.


0.2.0 - 2015-11-17
------------------

 DataAttributes:

 - IntAttribute has been renamed to IntegerAttribute, old class
   will vanish in a future release
 - allow Builder calls in any order (up to now the calls had to
   be sorted by class hierarchy, subclass first)
 - add getters for attribute values (minLength, nullable etc.)

 Bindings:

 - IntBinding has been renamed to IntegerBinding, old class will
   vanash in a future release
 - fix BooleanBinding for null values (now deselects the JCheckBox)
 - ProgressBarBinding now works with all NumberFormatAttributs, not
   only with IntAttribute

 Layouts:

 - fix missing 'linebreak' in DualColumnVerticalLayout when last line
   in a group was not empty

 Exceptions:
 
 - always initialize localized exception messages

 Resources:

 - Provide an empty Resource implementation that does not need a
   .property file and returns the given key while still providing
   parameter expansion.  Use the new default constructor for this.

 Build:

 - remove more Eclipse project stuff over to Gradle
 - check-l10n.pl now exits with error when keys are missing

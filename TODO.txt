TODO:

=== BUILD ===

- provide src and doc jars as well

- add Gradle file set for the demo project

- check-l10n: only call with path, detect and sort relevant files automatically

=== LIB ===

- BUG: windows filenames get their backslashes erased when an IOException is passed
  through a ValidationErrorList - find out what's de-escaping the backslashes

- make all Attribute constructors protected instead of private (easier extension)

- document all library classes and methods

- provide a simple and complete ProgressBarView

- add demo projects
  - simple calculator

- add BigDecimalAttribute, Binding etc.
  - same for Double

? simple logging framework

? general methods for look&feel selection / AutoLayout selection
  - automatic commandline parsing or such

=== UI ===

- BUG: tooltip with error text missing on FileBinding

- print validation error for every element
  - validate/invalidate directly on value change
  - remove FormattedTextFieldVerifier class

- cascade validation errors
  - mark groups (eg. tabs) as invalid, if a value is invalid
  - use a lighter red and "$NUMBER errors" as tooltip

- add detailed field description as tooltip to label part of a DataBinding

- do something when image file is no image file (preview icon == null)

- SimpleVerticalLayout:
  - print headers bold or bigger, they are not really visible

- Metal L&F:
  - fix insets (text labels lower than textfields - looks good in other L&Fs)

- later: improve controls/bindings
  - variable text on "..." buttons in ColorBinding and FileBinding
  - provide a combined slider/textfield input for IntBinding and FloatBinding

- later: use message footer to print help text/validation error for current element

=== I18N ===

? don't give Resource as a parameter to Binding creation, give the complete String
  (it's optionally possible anyways)
  ? recheck this: every addBinding() with a R._("LBL_"+getAttributeName()..." would be stupid

=== DATA ===

- additional constraints
  ! check this, there is already something like this code (source file != target file)
    but does not seem to work
  - free code
  - not directly related to an attribute
  - e.g. "page border must be smaller than page width and page height"
  ? how to set/unset validation flag in UI (on which attribute for example)

? "editable" attribute for all attribute types

? persist DataModel in text/properties file, don't use object serialization
  - pro: manual editing possible
  - serialized Java objects should be forward-compatible through JRE versions
